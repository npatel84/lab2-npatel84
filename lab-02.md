# Lab 2:  ADT Stack Implementations

The goal of this lab is to implement the Stack Abstract Data Type using two different implementations:
1. The built in List construct in Python
1. The simple linked data structure covered in class   

As part of the Stack definition for this lab, we will specify a capacity
for the stack. In the case of the Python List implementation, you will
allocate a list of size capacity and use this to store the items in the
stack.  Since Lists in Python expand when more storage is needed, you
must avoid using any functions that would cause a List to expand (see
the list (haha) of forbidden methods/operations below).  This prevents
the stack from growing if the user accesses the List through the given
interface.  (This prevents the stack from using more space than a user
might want.  Think of this as a requirement for an application on a
small device that has very limited storage.)  For consistency, in the
simple linked data structure implementation, we will also have a
capacity attribute for the stack.

You are NOT allowed to use the following Python List operations (we will check!):
* all built-in list methods including:
  * `append()`
  * `insert()`
  * `extend()`
  * `remove()`
  * `pop()`
* `==` and `!=` between lists
* `del`
* `in`
* `len`
* `+` (concatenation of lists)
* List slicing (e.g. some_list[2:9])

Additional Requirements:
* All stack operations must have O(1) performance
* Your stack implementations must be able to hold values of None as valid data

The following starter files are available on GitHub, or at these links:
* [stack_array.py](./stack_array.py): Contains an array (Python List)
  based implementation of the Stack class
* [stack_linked.py](./stack_linked.py): Contains a linked based
  implementation of the Stack class
* [stack_tests.py](./stack_tests.py): Contains your set of thorough
  tests to ensure your implementations work correctly.  These tests must
  run correctly on ANY implementation that follows the specification.

(Note that the class in each stack implementation is named Stack, and
both implementations must follow the same specification. This allows
one set of tests in stack_tests.py that can be used for both
implementations by just changing which file is used when importing
Stack.)
